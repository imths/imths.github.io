Stack Overflow is an online community driven discussion board where many programmers and developers come together to answer questions anyone might have on concepts or ideas in terms of coding or other fields of technology.
Since it is a community-run website, there are people from all over the world with all sorts of different fields of knowledge and experiences, and not many questions go unsolved for long. There is also the opportunity for multiple solutions or answers to be given to a single question, providing different perspectives and approaches for certain topics.

## Strategy: Posing Smart Questions

One of the best ways to ensure a question is answered as quickly and effectively on Stack Overflow is to ask good and smart questions, which has many advantages over posing a simple question on your topic that took you five seconds to come up with, or the first question that you wanted answered as quickly as possible.
A smart question should, obviously, be well thought out and prepared well, which shows your level of understanding on the topic at hand as well as what specifically you want the answer to, or where your level of knowledge falls short. However, this does not mean that a poster should spend hours compiling their entire thoughts on the matter, as there should be a short explanation of the problem, not an entire life story leading up to the present.
There should be as much background information given as needed for readers to fully comprehend the context behind the question being asked and it should be clear what the goal or end goal the answer should provide.

## The Search

In the future, I would like to be able to comfortably handle both the front and back-end sides of any project that I happen to come across or start one day. If I were to develop the skills to do this, it would widen the number of possibilities and opportunities that I would be able to take advantage of and I would be able to bring a lot more to the table. Plus, I have always enjoyed seeing the interactions between things all around me, and trying to figure out how they work, and if any problems were to come up, I would always try and come up with ideas of my own on how to fix them or why they happened. I am currently working in a team that handles the UI and API side of a web application for UH, but am not yet fully confident in my ability to smoothly tackle problems and integrate solutions or new features.

## Bridging the Gap Between Software and Hardware

Every once in a while, I would have random ideas pop into my head on possible products that could be sold with the goal of solving a problem or making a person’s day-to-day life easier or more efficient. There would also be times when I notice a small problem in my life or someone complaining about a small inconvenience that got me thinking about how I would go about solving these problems with a tool or gadget. I would also spend time focusing on some of the larger problems in the world as well, but there are millions if not billions of ideas out there already, and the actual problem lies in how to execute such a plan on such a wide scale. I’m always thinking about problems and solutions, but since I have never really worked with connecting software to hardware, other than say, middle school robotics, I never knew how to act on these ideas or bring them to life. It is an interest of mine, but one that I have put in the back of my mind for the longest time, and it will likely stay there until I get more of an idea on how to start, or become successful enough to risk trying without worrying about the losses.
