# SkillShare (but for UH students)
Byron Soriano, Ayumu Yamagishi, Cristian Milanes, LaToya Gonzales, Jayrell Allen Ballesteros, Isaac Segawa

# Overview
**The problem**: College students struggling to find mentors and peers who wish to reach out and learn certain interests but don’t know how to. Missed opportunities for skill development.

**The solution**: SkillHub is an online platform designed to provide access to student-made tutorials on certain skills or aspects of a skill. Whether you're a high school student exploring different career paths or a college student looking to expand your expertise, SkillHub provides a community where you can learn many new things.

# Approach
This application will be similar to SkillShare but tailored to the UH community.

Students can create a profile and input possible interests that they have and any skills that they are willing to teach to others. “Teachers” can list any contact information they feel comfortable with so any other students can ask them any questions.

The app would allow students to create “classes” for skills that they have their class be shown on a page with those who are interested to learn. Each class would be categorized on what skill set they focus on and be organized like that on the page.

Within each class page there will be a description of the tutorial/class and a way to organize events with those who sign up for the class. Additionally, the class would have a forum for those who are involved to have discussions and meet other similar minded students.

- Mockup pages
- Landing page
- User profile page
- Browsing page
- Admin page
- Report tutorial page
- Categories/Tag Management 
- Log in/Sign up
- Tutorial Chat/Forum
- Skill announcements/events

# Use case ideas
New users: Landing page -> Sign Up/Profile Creation -> Skill “Hub” -> Search -> Specific Skill page

Admins: Landing page -> Sign In -> Reported Tutorials -> Edits/Deletes tutorials

Users: Landing page -> Sign In -> Skill “Hub” -> Search -> Specific Skill page

# Beyond the basics
After the basic implementation of the skill hub pages, we can always add more:

* Progress tracking
* Feedback and ratings
* User Achievements
