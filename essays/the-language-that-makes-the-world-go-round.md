JavaScript is a programming language that is used across the vast majority of the web and its sites to include interaction with the user and add certain behaviors to a page’s elements. It is one of the core essential languages that helps the gears of the World Wide Web continue to turn and work smoothly. Knowledge of the language should be a must for anyone interested in programming or aiming to begin development of their own, and can turn a plain, decent website to a complex and great one.

## JavaScript after 6 years

I have worked with JavaScript in previous projects, and am familiar with the basic workings of the language, enough to support some of the ideas I made into reality, but there will always be some things that I have yet to learn. I began learning and working with JS around six or seven years ago, when I first embarked on my coding/programming journey after I became interested in the field and started taking some related classes in high school. Just recently, when going through some courses that went over the basics of JavaScript and how to use the different parts and components of the language, there were many new topics presented to me, mainly from the (fairly) recent addition of ECMAScript 6 (ES6). In past projects, I had used only what I knew at the time, which would have been around the time where ES 6 had been out for only a couple of years and when I was still learning JS.

## JavaScript as a language

Over the time I have spent learning about coding and programming, I have been introduced to and practiced with several different languages, that all claim to be the best in their own right. These languages include Java, JavaScript, CSS, C, C++, and Python, which are all good languages to start learning how to code with. I would have to say that I prefer JavaScript over the other languages, simply because it was one of the languages that I learned closer to the beginning of my learning, and because it made many coding concepts and ideas easy to understand and implement. JavaScript is great for handling all the different processes that a website or application might include and is the language I would likely turn to if I was designing an application that had to handle a bunch of operations.

## Athletic Software Engineering with JS

I like the idea of creating and practicing certain objectives or “workouts” that force us to implement a function (or multiple) under a certain time limit. It is great for practicing our programming skills under pressure similar to an interview and pointing out what we might not know and what we need to work on in the future. The different time limits and time goals that we have to compare ourselves to can serve as both motivation and discouragement, depending on the results and the user’s mindset. Despite the possible discouragement aspect of these tests, it gives us important information as to how we can improve while also teaching the way to approach a certain problem.Overall, I like the workouts of the day and like seeing where I stand right now, but they can be stressful at times, depending on the topic and difficulty of the objective.
